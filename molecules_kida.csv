Then, we assume that the binding energy of the species with ASW is proportional to the energy of interaction between this species and one water molecule. To determine the proportionality coefficients, we fit the dependency of the experimental binding energies versus the calculated energies of the complexes for 16 stable molecules. Uncertainties in ED is estimated to be 30%. The preexponential factor is to be computed using the Hasegawa et al. (1992) approximation.

To determine the proportionality coefficients, we fit the dependency of the experimental binding energies versus the calculated energies of the complexes for 16 stable molecules.
